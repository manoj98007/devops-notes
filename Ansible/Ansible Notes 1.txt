Difference between Terraform and Ansible Provisioning
Letâ€™s see how Terraform vs. Ansible battle differentiates from each other:

                       Terraform                                                                                                   	Ansible
1) Terraform is a provisioning tool.	                                                            |    Ansible is a configuration management tool.
2) It is the best fit for orchestrating cloud services and setup cloud infrastructure from scratch. |	 It is mainly used for configuring servers with the right software and updates already configured resources.
3) Terraform does not support bare metal provisioning by default.	                            |    Ansible supports the provisioning of bare metal servers.
4) It does not provide better support in terms of packaging and templating.                         | 	 It provides full support for packaging and templating.

Ansible Inventory 
	 Static Inventory
		- It is file which contains the ip and configuration of connection to target host machines 
		  on which we want execute our playbooks
		- we can group the hosts in inventory.
		- default location of host file is /etc/ansible/hosts
		- each line except group name is considered as a single host connection configuration.
		[frontend]
		13.233.104.27 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_become_user=root
		15.206.185.128 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_become_user=root

		[backend]
		15.206.185.128 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_become_user=root
                - To pass custom inventory file "ansible -m ping -i <inventoryfile>"
		
	 Dynamic Inventory	
			- Is basically a script which will gives the inventory output.
			- we can use python, perl, bash 
                        - script provided by ansible https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/contrib/inventory/ec2.py  Using AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and command like "ansible-playbook -i ec2.py myplaybook.yml"
